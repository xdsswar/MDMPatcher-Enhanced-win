## Overview

MDMPatcher Enhanced is a macOS tool that helps remove or bypass Mobile Device Management (MDM) profiles from supervised iPhones and iPads. It is designed for scenarios where users need to regain full control over a personally owned device — for example after second-hand purchases or faulty deregistration.

No jailbreak is required. No low-level kernel or firmware modifications are performed.

### Application Preview

## Changes from the Original Repository
- **Improved documentation**
- **Bug fixes**
- **Troubleshooting section added**
- **Clarity improvements for restore & patching**

## Requirements
- macOS 10.13+ (Intel or Apple Silicon)
- iOS 15 to 18.5+
- iPhone 5s to iPhone 16
- All current iPads
- IPSW file for your device (from [ipsw.me](https://ipsw.me))

## Instructions
- Download the correct IPSW file for your device from [ipsw.me](https://ipsw.me).
  - To find the correct IPSW file for your iOS device:
    - Look up the model number on the back of your device (e.g., A1567).
    - Match the model number with the device name using a website like [The iPhone Wiki](https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Models). For example, A1567 corresponds to the iPad Air 2.
    - **Choose between Cellular and Wi-Fi versions:** If your device has a SIM card slot, download the Cellular IPSW; otherwise, download the Wi-Fi only version.
- Put your iOS device into recovery mode.
  - **For iPads without a Home button:** Press and hold the Top button while connecting it to your computer. Keep holding until the recovery mode screen appears.
  - **For iPads with a Home button:** Hold the Home button while connecting it to your computer. Keep holding until the recovery mode screen appears.
  - **For iPhones with Face ID or iPhone 8 and later:** Press and hold the Side Button while connecting it to your computer. Keep holding the button until the recovery mode screen appears.
  - **For iPhone 7 and 7 Plus:** Hold the Volume Down button and connect it to your computer.
  - **For iPhone 6s and earlier:** Hold the Home Button while connecting it to your computer.
- Once in recovery mode, a message will appear on your computer asking if you want to update or restore the device. **Hold the OPTION key** on your keyboard, then click either **Update** or **Restore**. This will allow you to choose the IPSW file you downloaded for your device.
- After restoration, follow initial setup **until you reach the Wi-Fi selection** screen. **Do NOT connect to ANY network!**
- Open the MDMPatcher app on your Mac.
- Disable SIP if the app won’t open (for M1 Macs: use csrutil disable in recovery mode terminal).
  - Read more at [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/disabling-and-enabling-system-integrity-protection)
- **Important:** Before opening the MDMPatcher app, open Finder, click on your iPad, and wait for it to finish activating (it will show "Get Started"). You may need to unplug and reconnect the cable if you encounter issues.
- When your device info shows in MDMPatcher, click "PATCH" to complete the process.
- After reboot, follow the remaining setup instructions on the device.

## Typical Issues
### Problem: Unable to Open MDMPatcher Enhanced
You might encounter a security warning preventing the app from opening, as shown below.
<br>

<br>
**Solution:**
1. Right-click the app and select Open.
2. If the app still won’t open, go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security** and under the Security section, allow the app by clicking Open Anyway.

### Problem: App Instantly Crashes on Launch
If the MDMPatcher Enhanced app crashes immediately upon opening, this is likely due to macOS's System Integrity Protection (SIP) blocking the app.

**Solution:**
1. Boot your Mac into Recovery Mode.
2. Open Terminal in Recovery Mode.
3. Type `csrutil disable` and press Enter.
4. Restart your Mac, then try opening the app again.

Be cautious when disabling SIP, as it reduces system security. Read more about it at [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/disabling-and-enabling-system-integrity-protection)

---

### Problem: Error Occurs While Patching
If an error occurs during the patching process, it’s often because the device hasn’t fully completed activation.

**Solution:**
1. Before opening MDMPatcher, open Finder on your Mac.
2. Click on your device in the Finder sidebar.
3. Wait for the device to fully activate (it will display "Get Started" when ready).
4. Then, proceed with the patching.

This should resolve most patching errors.

## Final Thoughts
This project aims to support lawful restoration of iOS/iPadOS devices that were improperly decommissioned. It provides a lightweight, GUI-driven alternative for tech-savvy users who understand the risks and legal limitations involved.
